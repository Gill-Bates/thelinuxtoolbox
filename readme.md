## All Scripts are designed and tested for Debian 10 (Buster)

With this repository I provide to the general public with a collection of helpful configuration settings.

It has taken me countless hours to gather all this information in various forums, Blog posts or at stackoverflow.com. Some of them were good, some incomplete, some obsolete, or many simply wrong. I would have always wished for a central place where all my documentation is located. ***Voila - here it is!***

## Game rules
* All scripts comes "as it is" - without any guarantee. Copy & Paste ***does not absolve you from using your brain!***
* Note: Submitting "Issues" or Pull Requests about my scripts are very welcome and appreciated. ***This is not a forum.*** Please do not create issues like "Does not work".
* The Editor "nano" is my favorite tool. If you prefer another editor, feel free to replace the command `nano` with yours.
* I have decided to use the distribution **Debian Buster 10**. It's my personal favorite. There are many other good distributions out there. But I can't test my scripts for all of them. Note that with other distributions (especially Raspberry PI on ARM architecture), these scripts may not work.
* Please note the ```"Tool Baseline" (03_importanttols.md)```. This is required for many of my tutorials. Make sure you have these tools installed on your VM.
