# The Linux Toolbox

## All Scripts are designed and testet for Debian 10 (Buster)

With this repository I provide the general public with a collection of helpful configuration settings.

It has taken me countless hours to gather all this information in various forums on the Internet. I would have always wished for a central place where all my documentation is located. Voila - here it is!

## Game rules
* All scripts are without guarantee. Copy & Paste does not absolve you from using your brain
* Notes "Issues" about my scripts are very welcome and appreciated. **This is not a forum.** Please do not create issues like "Does not work".
* The Editor "nano" is my favorite tool. If you prefer another editor, feel free to replace the command "nano" with yours.
* I have decided to use the distribution **Debian Buster 10**. Note that with other distributions (especially Raspberry PI on ARM architecture), these scripts may not work.
* Please note the ```"Tool Baseline" (03_importanttols.md)```. This is required for many of my tutorials. Make sure you have these tools installed on your VM.
